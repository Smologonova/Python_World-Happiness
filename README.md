# World-Happiness

An open-source data project using Python and Tableau to explore trends in happiness and determine which factors contribute the most to a country’s happiness score as a part of Data Analytics course at CareerFoundry.

## Objective
Scenario: To find an open-sourced data set and analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, various advanced analytical approaches should be used to help testing the hypotheses.

## Data 
Open source data: the World Happiness Report, which is a survey that ranks participating countries based off of their overall happiness available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report)

## Tools
- Excel – to analyze by coducting statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, find insights and prepare data for a [project interim report](https://github.com/Smologonova/Flu-Season_Analysis/blob/main/Interim%20report_Flu%20Season.pdf).
- Tableau - to turn data and insights into interactive storytelling, available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/iryna.smologonova/viz/Preparingforinfluenzaseason/PreparationtoupcominginfluenzaseasonintheUS).

## Result 
[Storytelling in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/iryna.smologonova/viz/Preparingforinfluenzaseason/PreparationtoupcominginfluenzaseasonintheUS?publish=yes)
- Focus on:
- 6 top states with the highest death rate: Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, District of Columbia, South and North Dakota, Vermont
- 5 top states with the highest elderly populations:California, Texas, Florida, New York and  Pennsylvania
- the influenza season months: Dec-Mar with a peak in Jan

## Key learning experience
- It is important to consider data limitations and assess the impact of it on the analysis and the result interpretation. As analysis progresses, data limitations may become apparent and should be added to the analysis plan.
- Data mapping helps to match variables between different data sets. Death data and population data by states were mapped using age variable on 10 years ranges starting from age of 5 years old.
- Normalization is a part of data preparation and allows data in different units to be compared using the same units. The flu deaths data was normalized according to state populations by deriving new variables representing flu deaths as a percentage of state population.
